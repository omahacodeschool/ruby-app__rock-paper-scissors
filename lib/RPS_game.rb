  # Method that runs the full RPS game for two players. 
  #
  # 'Set_max_games' Method is located in Players class > getter and setter method are linked in Game class for faster access.
  # 'name_all_players' Method is located in Players class > getter and setter method are linked in Game class for faster access.
  # 'play_through_set_of_games' Method is another game functionality Method for handling match gameplay. Found in the Game class. Use puts to return Strings generated from other method.
  # 'set_determine_set_winner' Method is located in Score_Count class. Determines overall winner based on number of games played.
  # 'overall_winner_message' Method is set in Game Class in Messages section. Returns overall victory message depending on which player won. 
  #
  # RETURNS entire game functionality + necessary text notifications throughout entire set of games + final result notification.

  # Method that loops through gameplay process based on the number of games the user wants to play.

  # get_played_games: Method is located in Players class > getter and setter method are linked in Game class for faster access. Returns number of played games thusfar.
  # get_max_games: Method is located in Players class > getter and setter method are linked in Game class for faster access. Returns number of max games to play, as declared by the user in another method
  # reset_player_weapons: Method is located in Players class > getter and setter method are linked in Game class for faster access. Forces the players to select new weapons at the start of each match. 
  # set_battle: Method is located in Players class > getter and setter method are linked in Game class for faster access. Determines match outcome based on weapons selected by each player
  # battle_outcome: Method located in Players section--but not directly linked to Player class. Modifies user or tie score and returns notification based on get_battle Method result.
  # set_played_games: Method is located in Players class > getter and setter method are linked in Game class for faster access. Increases the number of played games by 1 for each game played.
